                content={'Each muscle group covers a range of motion. When you push that range of motion, your muscles stretch. When you perform an exercise with a full range of motion, you are able to engage and activate more muscle fibers throughout the movement. This means that you can stimulate more muscle growth and development than if you were to perform the exercise with a limited range of motion.-.-Additionally, using a full range of motion during weight lifting can help to increase the time under tension (TUT) for your muscles. TUT refers to the amount of time that your muscles are under load during an exercise. By increasing TUT, you can increase muscle tearing and stimulate greater muscle growth and adaptation.'} // add links to where we go into more detail
