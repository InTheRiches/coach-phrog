                content={`Muscles are a dense tissue composed of anywhere from a thousand to a million **fibers**. Muscle fibers are the individual cells that make up muscles, and they have a unique ability to contract or shorten, resulting in movement. Think of muscle fibers as tiny "strings" that can pull on each other when they receive a signal to do so.-.-At the most basic level, muscle fibers contain tiny units called sarcomeres. These sarcomeres are like building blocks within the muscle fibers. They consist of proteins called actin and myosin. Actin and myosin are arranged in a specific pattern, with myosin filaments and actin filaments overlapping each other.-.-Muscles are activated by signals from our nervous system, which is like the body's electrical wiring. When we want to move, our brain sends a signal through our nervous system to the muscle that needs to **contract**. This signal triggers a series of chemical reactions inside the muscle fibers.-.-The myosin filaments, which have tiny "arms" sticking out, grab onto the actin filaments and start pulling them closer together. As the myosin arms pull on the actin, the sarcomeres become **shorter**. It's like a bunch of people pulling on a rope and bringing their hands closer together.-.-This shortening of the sarcomeres causes the entire muscle fiber to **contract**. When many muscle fibers contract at the same time, the whole muscle becomes shorter and tighter, resulting in movement. This is how your muscles enable you to perform actions like bending your arm, walking, or smiling.-.-To relax the muscle and return to its original length, the myosin and actin filaments slide back apart, and the muscle fiber lengthens again.-.-This process requires **energy** in the form of ATP, and it continues as long as the muscle is receiving the signal to contract. So, when you move a muscle, the tiny filaments inside the muscle fibers are grabbing and pulling on each other to make the whole muscle get shorter and perform movement.`}

                content={"Your body is built to adapt, and your muscles are no exception. When challenged through an activity like weightlifting, the muscles grow and strengthen to combat the new challenge and demand. When you exercise, your muscle fibers will often **tear** and break down.-.-This might sound bad, but it's actually a good thing! When these tiny fibers are damaged, it triggers a response from your body to **repair** and rebuild them **stronger** and bigger than before. This process is called muscle [/muscles/training/hypertrophy,hypertrophy] (hy·per·tro·phy), and it's how muscles grow.-.-To support muscle growth, you need to give your body the right fuel and rest. Eating a balanced diet that includes plenty of protein is important because protein helps to repair and build new muscle fibers. Getting enough sleep and rest is also crucial because it allows your body to **recover** and **rebuild** the muscles that were damaged during exercise."}

                title={"Muscle Heads"}
                content={'Some muscles are made up of multiple "heads". These parts of the muscle attach to different bones in your body and work together to perform **movement**. For example, the biceps muscle in your upper arm has two heads - the "long head" and the "short head". These heads attach to different parts of your shoulder blade and forearm bone, respectively.-.-Each head of a muscle can work independently or together with the other heads of the same muscle. This means that different heads can produce different movements or help to **stabilize** joints in different ways.-.-For example, let\'s go back to the biceps muscle. The long head of the biceps attaches to a part of the shoulder blade called the "supraglenoid tubercle". This attachment point allows the long head to help **stabilize the shoulder joint** when you lift your arm. Meanwhile, the short head of the biceps attaches to the forearm bone called the "radius". This attachment point allows the short head to help flex the elbow joint when you curl your arm.-.-By working together, the different heads of a muscle can produce complex movements that require multiple joints to move. For example, when you lift a heavy object towards your shoulder, you\'re using both the long and short heads of the biceps to stabilize your shoulder joint and flex your elbow joint.'}

                content={`**Muscle soreness** is the feeling of discomfort or pain in your muscles that you might experience after exercising or doing physical activities. It's like when you feel a bit achy or stiff in your muscles after playing sports or doing exercise.-.-There are multiple reasons why you might feel sore. As mentioned before, when your muscles are pushed during an activity like weight lifting, small **tears** in the fibers can occur. These tears can feel sore and achy while they are recovering. This often results in **Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness** (DOMS). It's called "delayed onset" because it doesn't happen right away. It's like when you eat something spicy, and your mouth feels fine at first, but a little while later, it starts to feel really hot. DOMS usually kick in **a day or two** after intense exercise, and only last a day or two.-.-Another reason is due to **lactic acid**. When your muscles contract, they require ATP. The most efficient way to get ATP requires oxygen (cellular respiration), which is not always available. Your body substitutes with fermentation, which does not require oxygen. As a compromise, it only partially breaks down **glucose** (your body’s main energy source), which produces lactic acid as a byproduct. Your body is really good at clearing this lactic acid out, but it often cannot keep up during high intensity activities. This results in a **buildup** of lactic acid, which can cause a burning sensation within the muscle. This lactic acid can also stay in the muscle for a few days as it is progressively cleared out, resulting in prolonged soreness.`}
